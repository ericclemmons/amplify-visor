# Amplify Visor â€“ ðŸ¥‡ 2021 AWS Amplpify Hackathon Entry

**NOTE â€“ This is a prototype and not an official AWS Amplify project.**

> Amplify Visor is a GUI that customers run locally that streamlines the Amplify app-building experience â€“ configuring &amp; deploying Amplify visually, automatically installing dependencies, and reducing developer friction.

## What is Amplify Visor?
 
* A visual representation of the CLI
* Visualizing the process in a way users understand
* Visualizing their current Amplify config & App
* Meeting the developers where they already are â€“ in their code.
* Smoothing out the constant context-switching thatâ€™s normal today. (e.g. starting/stopping servers, installing dependencies)
* Curated, Contextual Amplify experience with docs, help, support, configuration.
* Ability to do 1-click setups for pre-configured apps.
